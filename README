1. People Localization [1]

2. Tracklet Genearation [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracklets represent the position of an individual in a given scene at a given point of time. Many 
tracklets can be combined to get the trajectory of the individual for the corresponding time 
interval.


3. Social Affinity Maps [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAM is a feature descriptor that represents the behavioral signature of neighbouring pedestrians 
in a crowd. Each pedestrian in the crowd can be represented by SAM at a given point of time. SAM 
is essentially a radial histogram representation of the neighborhood of the pedestrian.
It captures the number of tracklets in a small neighborhood of the pedestrian and bins them in 
10 segments, thus constructing the histogram. 
This histogram is then quantized to get a binary vector of 10 components. We use HAMMING DISTANCE 
as the distance measure between two SAM descriptors.
